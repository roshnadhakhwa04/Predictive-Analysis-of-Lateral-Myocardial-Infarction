A Machine Learning-Based Multiclass Classification Framework for Lateral Myocardial Infarction Using Clinical and ECG Data

Abstract:

This project explores the development of a predictive machine learning model to classify the type of lateral myocardial infarction (MI) using a structured clinical and electrocardiographic (ECG) dataset. The dataset comprises detailed patient records, including demographic, historical, ECG, and biochemical features. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and supervised learning models (SVM and Random Forest), we developed an end-to-end pipeline to handle imbalanced data, optimize model performance, and interpret key predictive features.

1. Introduction:

Cardiovascular diseases, particularly myocardial infarctions, are among the leading causes of mortality globally. ECG and clinical history remain key tools for diagnosis. This study aims to apply machine learning to classify the type of lateral MI based on historical patient data. Our focus is on building a robust and interpretable model pipeline capable of handling class imbalance, optimizing accuracy, and delivering clinically meaningful insights.

2. Dataset Overview:

* **Source:** `Ass.csv` (with definitions from `codebookAss2.pdf`)
* **Records:** Each row represents a unique patient encounter
* **Features:** 100+ features including demographics, cardiac history, ECG patterns, lab values
* **Target Variable:** `lat_im` (indicating the type of lateral MI: values 0‚Äì4)

3. Methodology:

3.1 Data Preprocessing:

* **ID column removed** as it holds no predictive value.
* **Missing values** handled based on skewness:

  * Median imputation for skewed numerical columns
  * Mean imputation for normally distributed features
  * Mode imputation for categorical features

3.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Distributions visualized via histograms and boxplots
* Correlation heatmaps constructed to detect multicollinearity
* Highly correlated features (threshold > 0.6) were dropped

3.3 Handling Class Imbalance:

* Since the target variable (`lat_im`) was imbalanced, we applied:

  * `class_weight='balanced'` in both SVM and Random Forest
  * This ensures higher penalties on misclassified minority classes during training

3.4 Feature Scaling:

* All numeric features were scaled using `StandardScaler` for better performance with SVM

4. Model Training and Evaluation:

4.1 Support Vector Machine (SVM):

* GridSearchCV used to tune `C`, `gamma`, and `kernel`
* Best parameters selected based on 5-fold cross-validation
* Evaluation metrics:

  * Accuracy
  * Confusion Matrix
  * Classification Report
  * F1-scores (macro, micro, weighted)

4.2 Random Forest Classifier:

* GridSearchCV applied to optimize `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, and `min_samples_leaf`
* Feature importances visualized to interpret top predictors
* Same evaluation metrics as SVM used

4.3 Multiclass Performance Visualization:

* Per-class precision, recall, and F1-scores plotted
* Confusion matrices saved as heatmaps for both models
